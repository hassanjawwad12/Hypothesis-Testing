# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis testing and calculating confidence intervals for the Heart Disease UCI dataset.
<h2>This is the description of the dataset</h2>

1)age


2)sex

3)chest pain type (4 values)

4)resting blood pressure

5)serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6)fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7)resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8)maximum heart rate achieved

9)exercise induced angina

10)oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

11)number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

12)thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
